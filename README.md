# My_Game_Board_Java
This code is My_Game for my Java class project(BS): You can see moving squares on the game board. In this version, you have to click on the board at the right time and right place. The vertical line will appear on the board. It will take some time. You win if, during this time, no square touches your line. I put the source code, and you can change the square's speed, add another horizontal line, timer,  and so on.
